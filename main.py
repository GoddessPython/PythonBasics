print('The order of operations (also called precedence) of Python math operators is similar to that of mathematics. The ** operator is evaluated first; the *, /, //, and % operators are evaluated next, from left to right; and the + and - operators are evaluated last (also from left to right). You can use parentheses to override the usual precedence if you need to. Whitespace in between the operators and values doesnâ€™t matter for Python (except for the indentation at the beginning of the line), but a single space is convention. Enter the following expressions into the interactive shell and see what happens:')
